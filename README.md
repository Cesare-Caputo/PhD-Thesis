Thesis title:

"A novel data-driven approach to analyse flexibility in engineering systems under uncertainty"

Focuses on a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to real options analysis in engineering systems design and planning, with a focus in the energy space.

Chapter 4: Proof of concept on Garage case study. Double Q learning algorithm. 


Chapter 5: Methodological expansion on waste to energy system case study, shifting to policy gradients algorithm (Trust region policy optimization).


Chapter 6: Methodological maturation on flexible mobile microgrid for nomadic communities. Shift to actor-critic type agents, several types tested. 


Chapter 7: Evaluation of policy implications from the computational framework developed.


Chapter 8: Considerations of risk sensitivity via a distributional approach (preliminary)
